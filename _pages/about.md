I am Shi Jiarui (史佳睿), a  Ph.D. student in theNortheast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, CAS. My Ph.D. advisors are [Dr. Kaishan Song](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~songkaishan)) and Dr. [Dr. Zuchuan Li](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/zuchuan.li/research)).  I am a researcher specializing in **inland water remote sensing** and **aquatic environmental monitoring**, with a focus on leveraging remote sensing technologies and deep learning methods to study the optical properties and ecological processes of inland waters. My research interests include **optical atmospheric correction**, **water quality parameter retrieval**, **lake net ecosystem production (NEP) estimation**, and the **application of deep learning in aquatic remote sensing**. By integrating remote sensing data with machine learning algorithms, I aim to improve the accuracy of monitoring and predicting the ecological health of inland waters, providing scientific support for water resource management and environmental protection. My work is dedicated to advancing innovative applications of remote sensing in aquatic research and contributing to the understanding of water ecosystems in the context of global climate change.
